Created remote repo on github.com
verify and fix git config global for use.name and email
added vscode as default editor. difftool is not set yet
run git init in the workspace
clone remote repo              git clone https://github.com/ShrutiGoudar/GitPractice.git
verify with git remote -v
generated personal-git login id rsa key and added it in the ssh setting (at this point not clear if i am actually using it )
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "abcde@gmail.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github_personal
verify it  :     eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Goto developer setting of github.com and generate personal token . I will be using this directly for push as I have multiple logins and i dont want to mess up other login's stored credentials.
> pushURLPTA="https://ShrutiGoudar:ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx@github.com/ShrutiGoudar/GitPractice.git"
> git push $pushURLPTA test_github
Similarly git pull :
 git pull $pushURLPTA test_github

I see merge conflicts arising when I used commit amend followed by pull. Need to find right way to avoid getting into merge conflicts
